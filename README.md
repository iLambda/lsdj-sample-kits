# LSDJ sample kits

This GitHub repository contains different samples in the form of .kit files for LSDJ. To patch them into a given ROM, use [jkotlinski/lsdpatch](https://github.com/jkotlinski/lsdpatch).
They're tested, and work well on a GameBoy DMG-01 with LSDJ v4.8.0.

The [following tutorial](http://chipmusic.org/forums/topic/12080/lsdj-kit-creation-thread-dropbox-link/) was used to format the sounds to ready them for use as samples.
